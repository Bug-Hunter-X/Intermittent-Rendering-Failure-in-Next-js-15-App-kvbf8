# Next.js 15 Intermittent Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in a Next.js 15 application where the initial render occasionally fails to display the correct content.  The application appears to render a blank page or shows incomplete content. The problem seems to be related to server-side rendering (SSR) and is intermittent in nature, not consistently reproducible.

## Bug Description

The main issue is an intermittent failure to properly render the content on the initial page load. The cause is likely an issue with the SSR process not completing correctly or some form of race condition.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the data fetching and rendering processes are synchronized to prevent race conditions and to gracefully handle potential errors during SSR.  Adding error handling and fallback mechanisms can improve the user experience.
